TYPO3 extension taxajax
=======================

What is does
------------

This extension provides the xAjax PHP Class Library Version 0.2.4. It is
used by other TYPO3 extensions like tt_products.

Usage
-----

In your extension.

TypoScript
~~~~~~~~~~

You must set this TypoScript to get the absolute image path:

.. code::

   config.absRefPrefix = /

or

.. code::

   config.absRefPrefix = auto

Otherwise an image url “fileadmin/myimage.png” will not be found,
because HTML will generate a path like
“https://example.com/subpage1/subpage2/fileadmin/myimage.png” out of it.
Only an image url like “/fileadmin/myimage.png” can be found,


Extension Development:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the following line into the file ext_localconf.php of your extension
my_ext.

.. code:: php

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['taxajax_include']['my_ext'] =  \MyDomain\MyExt\Controller\TaxajaxController::class . '::processRequest';

The links generated by typolink must contain this element inside of the
querystring:

.. code:: php

   $addQueryString = [
       'taxajax' => 'my_ext'
   ];


The links generated by typolink must contain this element inside of the
querystring:

.. code:: php

   $addQueryString = [
       'eID' => 'my_ext'
   ];


Routing Enhancer:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

xajax PHP Class Library
=======================

The easiest way to develop asynchronous Ajax applications with PHP

Version 0.2.4 (stable release)
------------------------------

1. Introduction

xajax is a PHP library that you can include in your PHP scripts to
provide an easy way for Web pages to call PHP functions or object
methods using Ajax (Asynchronous Javascript And XML). Simply register
one or more functions/methods with the xajax object that return a proper
XML response using the supplied response class, add a statement in your
HTML header to print the Javascript include, and run a request processor
prior to outputting any HTML. Then add some simple Javascript function
calls to your HTML, and xajax takes care of the rest!

xajax includes a Javascript object to facilitate the communication
between the browser and the server, and it can also be used as a
Javascript library directly to simplify certain DOM and event
manipulations. However, you can definitely choose to use a dedicated
Javascript “engine” of your liking and integrate it with xajax’s
client/server communication features in a number of ways. More
tightly-coupled integration will be forthcoming in a future version of
xajax.

2. For More Information

The official xajax Web site is located at: `Xajax <https://github.com/Xajax/Xajax>`_

The development has been finished in October 2014.

3. Installation

To run xajax, you need:

* Apache Web Server or IIS for Windows XP/2003
Server (other servers may work)
* PHP 8.0 and later

To install xajax:

Unpack the contents of this archive and copy them to
your main Web site folder. Or if you wish, you can put all of the files
in a dedicated “xajax” folder on your Web server (make sure that you
know what that URL is relative your site pages so you can provide xajax
with the correct installed folder URL).
